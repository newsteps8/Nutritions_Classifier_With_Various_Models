# Nutritions_Classifier_With_Various_Models
By using the ratios of various nutritional values ​​as data, it is aimed to find out which foods are closer to animal, vegetable or mixed food types. Using various supervised and unsupervised classification models, the efficiency of these models was evaluated by looking at the F1-score values.


|        Model        |     Score     |
| -------------       | ------------- |
|LineerRegression     |     0.30      |
|LogisticRegression   |     0.73      |
|RandomForestRegressor|     0.92      |


As can be seen, while working with continious numeric data, one of the efficient modeling can be done with RandomForestRegressior.
